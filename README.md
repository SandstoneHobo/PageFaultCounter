# PageFaultCounter

To run the program use the .exe file in the github repo

Upon starting the program, the user will be prompted for a reference string, which needs to be a list of numbers seperated with commas or spaces ie. 5, 6, 7, 8 or 5 6 7 8 9

Next, the program will ask for a number of frames, this will be used as the maximum number of physical frames available to the program

Lastly, the program will ask for a code to decide which algorithm will be used. (FIFO for First In First Out algorithm, OPT for optimal algorithm, LRU for Least Recently Used algorithm)

With all of these inputs, the program will print each step of working through the reference string and the associated page fault count
